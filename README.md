Network Science Project - Ansuini Francesco, Del Savio Anna, Tomaselli Francesco

This is a project for the course Network Science, held by Tomaso Erseghe at the University of Padua.

This project is about the analysis of data concerning exports from all countries in the world, with a subsequent analysis of the resulting directed network.

In this repository there is:
- A Python File "DataDownloader.py" which was used to scrape data from the World Integrated Trade Solution website;
- An R File "AdjacencyMatrixConverter.R" which was used to create the adjacency matrix;
- A .ipynb notebook "NetworkScienceProject.ipynb" used to carry out community detection using louvain algorithm
- Another R File "Utils.R" used to carry out data transformations and various kinds of data manipulation 

Also, some steps in the data processing/pre-processing were carried out through the use of PowerQuery in Microsoft Excel
